     *   SPICE this is not a missing *file* — the terminal flavour
     *   ships a smaller library built without the rcbridge package, so the
     *   answer comes from probing it rather than looking for it.
     * @param uml whether the UML guest payload (libvmlinux.so + stub + passt)
     *   shipped. The terminal flavour drops all three and F-Droid builds skip
     *   the fetch, so like SPICE this is a missing-file gate.
