/**
 * Common abstraction over an active remote-desktop connection.
 *
 * Today: RDP and SPICE. `RdpSession` and `SpiceSession` live in
 * protocol-pure modules (`core/rdp`, `core/spice`) and are wrapped by
 * thin adapters in this package — see [RdpDesktopSession],
 * [SpiceDesktopSession]. The interface deliberately stays at the eight
 * verbs that [DesktopViewModel] used to type-dispatch, so the
 * abstraction is invisible to drivers and only collapses real
 * juxtapositions (VISION.md "places that look unified but aren't").
 *
 * Out of scope for v1:
 * - Keyboard input (VNC X11 keysym vs RDP scancode + Unicode is the
 *   most divergent surface; would require a `RemoteDesktopKeyEvent`
 *   ADT — separate work).
 * - Frame access / connection-state signalling (VNC pulls + throws,
 *   RDP pushes via callbacks — different signal patterns, separate
 *   design pass).
 *
 * Mouse-button numbering follows the X11 convention (1=left, 2=middle,
 * 3=right, 4=scroll-up, 5=scroll-down). Adapters translate to whatever
 * their underlying driver expects.
