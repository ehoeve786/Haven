    // runtime classpath — :app:checkArm64DebugDuplicateClasses asks for it long
    // before buildRcloneNative has run, and `compileKotlin dependsOn(...)` is
    // far too late to help. Attaching builtBy to the file collection does not
    // survive AGP's artifact transform either.
    //
    // So: compile against it here (compileKotlin already depends on the task
    // that produces it), and fold its classes into this project's own jar
    // below. Consumers then get the bound classes through the ordinary project
    // dependency, with no raw file for them to resolve early.

// The gomobile classes, unpacked so they land in this project's **class output**

//
// Folding them into the jar alone is not enough, and the failure is silent. A
// java-library exposes two things to a consumer: the packaged jar, and the raw
// class directories. AGP dexes a project dependency's *class directories* for a
// debug build, and only runs over the *jar* for a minified release. So classes
// added at jar-packaging time reach a release APK and never reach a debug one:
//
//     classes dir:  sh/haven/rclone/bridge  2 .class   wgbridge  0 .class
//     packaged jar: sh/haven/rclone/bridge  2 .class   wgbridge  6 .class
//
// The debug APK therefore *referenced* sh.haven.rclone.binding.wgbridge with
// zero methods defined, and died on launch the moment TunnelManager touched
// WireGuard: NoClassDefFoundError, with a green build and no warning anywhere.
// Registering the unpacked directory as class output puts them on both routes.
// Unpacked into the Kotlin compile output on purpose, rather than into a
// directory of its own registered with `sourceSets.output.dir(...)`. That was
// tried first and does nothing: `output.dir()` adds to the source set's *extra*
// output directories, which are not part of `classesDirs`, and it is
// `classesDirs` that backs the outgoing CLASSES variant a consumer sees. The
// classes sat on disk and AGP never looked at them.

// puts this project's own classes.
