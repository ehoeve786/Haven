/**
 * Curated one-tap installer packs for cage/app-window guest apps (#470).
 *
 * A pack collates everything a working app-window setup needs — the guest
 * packages per family, config drops that fix silent-failure defaults, the
 * audio-bridge requirement, the app-window def to register, and optional
 * pinned assets. The installer sequence itself lives with the MCP tools
 * (`install_app_pack`); this file is pure data, cloned from the
 * [DistroCatalog] / DesktopEnvironment pattern so the same entries can back
 * an "Add from catalog" UI later.
 *
 * Trust model (phase 1): the catalog is compiled into the release — packs
 * execute shell in the guest, so trust rides on the APK signature, not on
 * anything fetched at runtime. Assets are pinned by sha256.
