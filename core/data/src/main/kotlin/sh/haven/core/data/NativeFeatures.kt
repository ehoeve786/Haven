/**
 * Which native payloads this build actually shipped.
 *
 * The terminal build flavour (#510) drops the remote-desktop, compositor and
 * media libraries to save ~20 MB. Rather than gate the UI on a `BuildConfig`
 * flag — which would have to be threaded into every feature module, since
 * `BuildConfig` is per-module — this asks the only question that matters:
 * is the library there?
 *
 * That is true by construction for both flavours, and it stays true for cases
 * a flag would miss: an ABI a library was never built for, an F-Droid build
 * that `scandelete`d something the recipe forgot to rebuild (#493), or a
 * `.so` that is present but not executable.
 *
 * This deliberately mirrors what `FfmpegExecutor.isAvailable()` and
 * `WaylandBridge.available` already do; those two are the precedent, not an
 * invention of this class.
